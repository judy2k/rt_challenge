# Ray Tracer Challenge in Rust

I'm implementing the code described in the book [The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/). So far this is proving to be an excellent project for
deepening my knowledge of Rust programming.

If you've stumbled on this repository by accident, I'd highly recommend you buy
a copy of the book and work through it yourself in whichever programming language
you prefer, instead of reading or re-using this code.
